graf--p graf-after--p">Very hot technology but definitely deserving to be in the cutting edge deep learning part of the course because they are not quite proven to be necessarily useful for anything but they are nearly there and will definitely get there. We are going to focus on the things where they are definitely going to be useful in practice and there is a number of areas where they may turn out to be useful but we don’t know yet. So I think the area that they are definitely going to be useful in practice is the kind of thing you see on the left of the slide — which is for example turning drawing into rendered pictures. This comes from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04732" data-href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04732" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a paper that just came out 2 days ago</a>, so there’s a very active research going on right now.</p><p name="c131" id="c131" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">From the last lecture [</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=1m4s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=1m4s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1:04</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">]: </strong>One of our diversity fellows Christine Payne has a master’s in medicine from Stanford and so she had an interest in thinking what it would look like if we built a language model of medicine. One of the things we briefly touched on back in lesson 4 but didn’t really talk much about last time is this idea that you can actually seed a generative language model which means you’ve trained a language model on some corpus and then you are going to generate some text from that language model. You can start off by feeding it a few words to say “here is the first few words to create the hidden state in the language model and generate from there please. Christine did something clever which was to seed it with a question and repeat the question three times and let it generate from there. She fed a language model lots of different medical texts and fed in questions as you see below:</p><figure name="546e" id="546e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_v6gjjQ9Eu_yyJnj5qJoMyA.png"></figure><p name="2c31" id="2c31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What Jeremy found interesting about this is it’s pretty close to being a believable answer to the question for people without master’s in medicine. But it has no bearing on reality whatsoever. He thinks it is an interesting kind of ethical and user experience quandary. Jeremy is involved in a company called doc.ai that’s trying to doing a number of things but in the end provide an app for doctors and patients which can help create a conversational user interface around helping them with their medical issues. He’s been continually saying to the software engineers on that team please don’t try to create a generative model using LSTM or something because they are going to be really good at creating bad advice that sounds impressive — kind of like political pundits or tenured professor who can say bullcrap with great authority. So he thought it was really interesting experiment. If you’ve done some interesting experiments, share them in the forum, blog, Twitter. Let people know about it and get noticed by awesome people.</p><h4 name="7f35" id="7f35" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">CIFAR10 [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=5m26s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=5m26s" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5:26</a>]</h4><p name="3970" id="3970" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let’s talk about CIFAR10 and the reason is that we are going to be looking at some more bare-bones PyTorch stuff today to build these generative adversarial models. There is no fastai support to speak up at all for GANs at the moment — there will be soon enough but currently there isn’t so we are going to be building a lot of models from scratch. It’s been a while since we’ve done much serious model building. We looked at CIFAR10 in the part 1 of the course and we built something which was getting about 85% accuracy and took a couple hours to train. Interestingly, there is a competition going on now to see who can actually train CIFAR10 the fastest (<a href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/#cifar10-train-time" data-href="https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/#cifar10-train-time" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DAWN</a>), and the goal is to get it to train to 94% accuracy. It would be interesting to see if we can build an architecture that can get to 94% accuracy because that is a lot better than our previous attempt. Hopefully in doing so we will learn something about creating good architectures, that will be then useful for looking at GANs today. Also it is useful because Jeremy has been looking much more deeply into the last few years’ papers about different kinds of CNN architectures and realizes that a lot of the insights in those papers are not being widely leveraged and clearly not widely understood. So he wants to show you what happens if we can leverage so me of that understanding.</p><h4 name="2121" id="2121" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl2/cifar10-darknet.ipynb" data-href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl2/cifar10-darknet.ipynb" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cifar10-darknet.ipynb</a> [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=7m17s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=7m17s" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">7:17</a>]</h4><p name="2948" id="2948" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The notebook is called <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/" data-href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">darknet</a> because the particular architecture we are going to look at is very close to the darknet architecture. But you will see in the process that the darknet architecture as in not the whole YOLO v3 end-to-end thing but just the part of it that they pre-trained on ImageNet to do classification. It’s almost like the most generic simple architecture you could come up with, so it’s a really great starting point for experiments. So we will call it “darknet” but it’s not quite that and you can fiddle around with it to create things that definitely aren’t darknet. It’s really just the basis of nearly any modern ResNet based architecture.</p><p name="252d" id="252d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">CIFAR10 is a fairly small dataset [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=8m6s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=8m6s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">8:06</a>].

We are not going to use that here because these images are so small that trying to rotate a 32 by 32 image a bit is going to introduce a lot of blocky distortions. So the standard transformations that people tend to use is a random horizontal flip and then we add 4 pixels (size divided by 8) of padding on each side. One thing which works really well is by default fastai does not add black padding which many other libraries do. Fastai takes the last 4 pixels of the existing photo and flip it and reflect it, and we find that we get much better results by using reflection padding by default. Now that we have 40 by 40 image, this set of transforms in training will randomly pick a 32 by 32 crops, so we get a little bit of variation but not heaps.

In practice, people have found Leaky ReLU more useful on smaller datasets and less useful in big datasets.

Back when we last did CIFAR10, we oversimplified this (cheated a little bit). We had <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">x</code> coming in and we put that through a <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">conv</code>, then we added it back up to <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">x</code> to go out. In the real ResBlock, there are two of them.

We have some <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ni</code> coming in (some number of input channels/filters). The way the darknet folks set things up is they make every one of these Res layers spit out the same number of channels that came in, and Jeremy liked that and that’s why he used it in <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ResLayer</code> because it makes life simpler. The first conv halves the number of channels, and then second conv doubles it again. So you have this funneling effect where 64 channels coming in, squished down with a first conv down to 32 channels, and then taken back up again to 64 channels coming out.</p><p name="730e" id="730e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Question:</strong> Why is <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">inplace=True</code> in the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">LeakyReLU </code>[<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=17m54s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=17m54s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">17:54</a>]? Thanks for asking! A lot of people forget this or don’t know about it, but this is a really important memory technique. If you think about it, this <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">conv_layer</code>, it’s the lowest level thing, so pretty much everything in our ResNet once it’s all put together is going to be many <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">conv_layer</code>’s. If you do not have <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">inplace=True</code>, it’s going to create a whole separate piece of memory for the output of the ReLU so it’s going to allocate a whole bunch of memory that is totally unnecessary. Another example is that the original <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">forward</code> in <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ResLayer</code> looked like:</p><pre name="b54a" id="b54a" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">def</strong> forward(self, x): <strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">return</strong> x + self.conv2(self.conv1(x))</pre><p name="13cf" id="13cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">Hopefully some of you might remember that in PyTorch pretty much every every function has an underscore suffix version which tells it to do it in-place. <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">+</code> is equivalent to <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">add</code> and in-place version of <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">add</code> is <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">add_</code> so this will reduce memory usage:</p><pre name="9e76" id="9e76" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">def</strong> forward(self, x): <strong class="markup--strong markup--pre-strong">return</strong> x.add_(self.conv2(self.conv1(x)))</pre><p name="a52c" id="a52c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">These are really handy little tricks. Jeremy forgot the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">inplace=True</code> at first but he was having to decrease the batch size to much lower amounts and it was driving him crazy — then he realized that that was missing.

Immediately after the <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Conv</code>, there is a <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">BatchNorm</code>. Remember, <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">BatchNorm</code> has 2 learnable parameters for each activation — the thing you multiply by and the thing you add. If we had bias in <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Conv</code> and then add another thing in <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">BatchNorm</code>, we would be adding two things which is totally pointless — that’s two weights where one would do. So if you have a BatchNorm after a <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Conv</code>, you can either tell <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">BatchNorm</code> not to include the add bit or easier is to tell <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Conv</code> not to include the bias. There is no particular harm, but again, it’s going to take more memory because that is more gradients that it has to keep track of, so best to avoid.</p><p name="d926" id="d926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also another little trick is, most people’s <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">conv_layer</code>’s have padding as a parameter [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=21m11s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=21m11s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">21:11</a>]. But generally speaking, you should be able to calculate the padding easily enough. If you have a kernel size of 3, then obviously that is going to overlap by one unit on each side, so we want padding of 1. Or else, if it’s kernel size of 1, then we don’t need any padding. So in general, padding of kernel size “integer divided” by 2 is what you need. There’re some tweaks sometimes but in this case, this works perfectly well. Again, trying to simplify my code by having the computer calculate stuff for me rather than me having to do it myself.</p><figure name="0768" id="0768" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_Pc3_ut-tOnPm5FLdYqRrOA.png"></figure><p name="8cc8" id="8cc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Another thing with the two <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">conv_layer</code>’s [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=22m14s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=22m14s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">22:14</a>]: We had this idea of bottleneck (reducing the channels and then increase them again), there is also what kernel size to use. The first one has 1 by 1 <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Conv</code>. What actually happen in 1 by 1 conv? If we have 4 by 4 grid with 32 filters/channels and we will do 1 by 1 conv, the kernel for the conv looks like the one in the middle. When we talk about the kernel size, we never mention the last piece — but let’s say it’s 1 by 1 by 32 because that’s the part of the filters in and filters out. The kernel gets placed on the first cell in yellow and we get a dot product these 32 deep bits which gives us our first output. We then move it to the second cell and get the second output. So there will be bunch of dot products for each point in the grid. It is allowing us to change the dimensionality in whatever way we want in the channel dimension. We are creating <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ni//2</code> filters and we will have <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ni//2</code> dot products which are basically different weighted averages of the input channels. With very little computation, it lets us add this additional step of calculations and nonlinearities. It is a cool trick to take advantage of these 1 by 1 convs, creating this bottleneck, and then pulling it out again with 3 by 3 convs — which will take advantage of the 2D nature of the input properly. Or else, 1 by 1 conv doesn’t take advantage of that at all.</p><figure name="1cc4" id="1cc4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_-lUndrOFGp_FdJ27T_Px-g.png"></figure><p name="ebbf" id="ebbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">These two lines of code, there is not much in it, but it’s a really great test of your understanding and intuition about what is going on [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=25m17s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=25m17s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">25:17</a>] — why does it work? why do the tensor ranks line up? why do the dimensions all line up nicely? why is it a good idea? what is it really doing?

What they show is that this approach of a bottlenecking of decreasing the number of channels which is almost universal in ResNet is probably not a good idea. In fact, from the experiments, definitely not a good idea. Because what happens is it lets you create really deep networks. The guys who created ResNet got particularly famous for creating 1001 layer network. But the thing about 1001 layers is you can’t calculate layer 2 until you are finished layer 1. You can’t calculate layer 3 until you finish calculating layer 2. So it’s sequential. GPUs don’t like sequential. So what they showed is that if you have less layers but with more calculations per layer — so one easy way to do that would be to remove <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">//2</code>, no other changes:</p><figure name="5d7c" id="5d7c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*89Seymgfa5Bdx1_EXBW_lA.png" data-width="405" data-height="54" src="../img/1_89Seymgfa5Bdx1_EXBW_lA.png"></figure><p name="a309" id="a309" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Try this at home. Try running CIFAR and see what happens. Even multiply by 2 or fiddle around. That lets your GPU do more work and it’s very interesting because the vast majority of papers that talk about performance of different architectures never actually time how long it takes to run a batch through it. They say “this one takes X number of floating-point operations per batch” but they never actually bother to run it like a proper experimentalists and find out whether it’s faster or slower. A lot of the architectures that are really famous now turn out to be slow as molasses and take crap loads of memory and just totally useless because the researchers never actually bothered to see whether they are fast and to actually see whether they fit in RAM with normal batch sizes. So Wide ResNet paper is unusual in that it actually times how long it takes as does the YOLO v3 paper which made the same insight. They might have missed the Wide ResNet paper because the YOLO v3 paper came to a lot of the same conclusions but Jeremy is not sure they sited the Wide ResNet paper so they might not be aware that all that work has been done.

Self normalizing means it will always remain at a unit standard deviation and zero mean and therefore you don’t need batch norm. It hasn’t really gone anywhere and the reason is because it’s incredibly finicky — you have to use a very specific initialization otherwise it doesn’t start with exactly the right standard deviation and mean. Very hard to use it with things like embeddings, if you do then you have to use a particular kind of embedding initialization which doesn’t make sense for embeddings. And you do all this work, very hard to get it right, and if you do finally get it right, what’s the point? Well, you’ve managed to get rid of some batch norm layers which weren’t really hurting you anyway. It’s interesting because the SELU paper — the main reason people noticed it was because it was created by the inventor of LSTM and also it had a huge mathematical appendix. So people thought “lots of maths from a famous guy — it must be great!” but in practice, Jeremy doesn’t see anybody using it to get any state-of-the-art results or win any competitions.</p><p name="519a" id="519a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Darknet.make_group_layer</code> contains a bunch of <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">ResLayer</code> [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=31m28s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=31m28s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">31:28</a>]. <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">group_layer</code> is going to have some number of channels/filters coming in.

Then we are going to do a whole bunch of ResLayers — we can pick how many (2, 3, 8 etc) because remember ResLayers do not change the grid size and they don’t change the number of channels, so you can add as many as you like without causing any problems. This is going to use more computation and more RAM but there is no reason other than that you can’t add as many as you like. <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">group_layer</code>, therefore, is going to end up doubling the number of channels because the initial convolution doubles the number of channels and depending on what we pass in a <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">stride</code>, it may also halve the grid size if we put <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">stride=2</code>.

Nearly all of the network is going to be those bunches of layers and remember, every one of those group layers also has one convolution at the start. So then all we have is before that all happens, we are going to have one convolutional layer at the very start, and at the very end we are going to do our standard adaptive average pooling, flatten, and a linear layer to create the number of classes out at the end.

We’ve taken all that stuff and put it into a simple Python script, and he modified some of the parameters he mentioned to create something he called <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">wrn_22</code> network which doesn’t officially exist but it has a bunch of changes to the parameters we talked about based on Jeremy’s experiments. It has bunch of cool stuff like:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="29f3" id="29f3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Leslie Smith’s one cycle</li><li name="c368" id="c368" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Half-precision floating-point implementation</li></ul><figure name="3e8f" id="3e8f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_OhRBmhkrMWXgMpDHKZGJJQ.png"></figure><p name="4305" id="4305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is going to run on AWS p3 which has 8 GPUs and Volta architecture GPUs which have special support for half-precision floating-point.

And it’s also the first to integrate one cycle.</p><p name="ca20" id="ca20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What this actually does is it’s using PyTorch’s multi-GPU support [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=39m35s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=39m35s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">39:35</a>]. Since there are eight GPUs, it is actually going to fire off eight separate Python processors and each one is going to train on a little bit and then at the end it’s going to pass the gradient updates back to the master process that is going to integrate them all together. So you will see lots of progress bars pop up together.</p><figure name="73a2" id="73a2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_7JkxOliX34lgAkzwGbl1tA.png"></figure><p name="ca5b" id="ca5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">You can see it’s training three or four seconds when you do it this way. Where else, when Jeremy was training earlier, he was getting 30 seconds per epoch. So doing it this way, we can train things ~10 times faster which is pretty cool.</p><p name="6399" id="6399" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Checking on the status</strong> [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=43m19s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=43m19s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">43:19</a>]:</p><figure name="5215" id="5215" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_fgY5v-w-44eIBkkS4fPqEA.png"></figure><p name="2d4c" id="2d4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s done! We got to 94% and it took 3 minutes and 11 seconds. Previous state-of-the-art was 1 hour 7 minutes. Was it worth fiddling around with those parameters and learning a little bit about how these architectures actually work and not just using what came out of the box? Well, holy crap. We just used a publicly available instance (we used a spot instance so it costs us $8 per hour — for 3 minutes 40 cents) to train this from scratch 20 times faster than anybody has ever done it before. So that is one of the craziest state-of-the-art result. We’ve seen many but this one just blew it out of the water. This is partly thanks to fiddling around with those parameters of the architecture, mainly frankly about using Leslie Smith’s one cycle. Reminder of what it is doing [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=44m35s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=44m35s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">44:35</a>], for learning rate, it creates upward path that is equally long as the downward path so it’s true triangular cyclical learning rate (CLR). As per usual, you can pick the ratio of x and y (i.e. starting LR / peak LR). In</p><figure name="e742" id="e742" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_5lQZ0Jln6Cn29rd_9Bvzfw.png"></figure><p name="4a57" id="4a57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In this case, we picked 50 for the ratio. So we started out with much smaller learning rate. Then it has this cool idea where you get to say what percentage of your epochs is spent going from the bottom of the triangle all the way down pretty much to zero — that is the second number. So 15% of the batches are spent going from the bottom of our triangle even further.</p><figure name="4595" id="4595" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_E0gxTQ5sf4XSceo9pWKxWQ.png"></figure><p name="c7e4" id="c7e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">That is not the only thing one cycle does, we also have momentum. Momentum goes from&nbsp;.95 to&nbsp;.85. In other words, when learning rate is really low, we use a lot of momentum and when the learning rate is really high, we use very little momentum which makes a lot of sense but until Leslie Smith showed this in the paper, Jeremy has never seen anybody do it before. It’s a really cool trick. You can now use that by using <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">use-clr-beta</code> parameter in fastai (<a href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/using-use-clr-beta-and-new-plotting-tools/14702" data-href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/using-use-clr-beta-and-new-plotting-tools/14702" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">forum post by Sylvain</a>) and you should be able to replicate the state-of-the-art result. You can use it on your own computer or your paper space, the only thing you won’t get is the multi-GPU piece, but that makes it a bit easier to train anyway.</p><p name="e44a" id="e44a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Question</strong>: <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">make_group_layer</code> contains stride equals 2, so this means stride is one for layer one and two for everything else. What is the logic behind it? Usually the strides I have seen are odd [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=46m52s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=46m52s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">46:52</a>]. Strides are either one or two. I think you are thinking of kernel sizes. So stride=2 means that I jump two across which means that you halve your grid size. So I think you might have got confused between stride and kernel size there. If you have a stride of one, the grid size does not change. If you have a stride of two, then it does. In this case, because this is CIFAR10, 32 by 32 is small and we don’t get to halve the grid size very often because pretty quickly we are going to run out of cells. So that is why the first layer has a stride of one so we don’t decrease the grid size straight away. It is kind of a nice way of doing it because that’s why we have a low number at first <code class="markup--code markup--p-code">Darknet([1, 2, 4, 6, 3],&nbsp;…)</code>&nbsp;. We can start out with not too much computation on the big grid, and then we can gradually doing more and more computation as the grids get smaller and smaller because the smaller grid the computation will take less time</p><h3 name="3d3c" id="3d3c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)&nbsp;[<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=48m49s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=48m49s" class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">48:49</a>]</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="c8bf" id="c8bf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875" data-href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wasserstein GAN</a></li><li name="36df" id="36df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434" data-href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks</a></li></ul><p name="ef3f" id="ef3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We are going to talk about generative adversarial networks also known as GANs and specifically we are going to focus on Wasserstein GAN paper which included Soumith Chintala who went on to create PyTorch. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) was heavily influenced by the deep convolutional generative adversarial network paper which also Soumith was involved with. It is a really interesting paper to read. A lot of it looks like this:</p><figure name="c46b" id="c46b" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_9zXXZvCNC8_eF_V9LJIolw.png"></figure><p name="9660" id="9660" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The good news is you can skip those bits because there is also a bit that looks like this:</p><figure name="fe33" id="fe33" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="../img/1_T90I-RKpUzV7yyo_TOqowQ.png"></figure><p name="6909" id="6909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A lot of papers have a theoretical section which seems to be there entirely to get past the reviewer’s need for theory. That’s not true with WGAN paper. The theory bit is actually interesting — you don’t need to know it to use it, but if you want to learn about some cool ideas and see the thinking behind why this particular algorithm, it’s absolutely fascinating. Before this paper came out, Jeremy knew nobody who studied the math it’s based on, so everybody had to learn the math. The paper does a pretty good job of laying out all the pieces (you have to do a bunch of reading yourself). So if you are interested in digging into the deeper math behind some paper to see what it’s like to study it, I would pick this one because at the end of that theory section, you’ll come away saying “I can see now why they made this algorithm the way it is.”</p><p name="1b8b" id="1b8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The basic idea of GAN is it’s a generative model[<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=51m23s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=51m23s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">51:23</a>]. It is something that is going to create sentences, create images, or generate something. It is going to try and create thing which is very hard to tell the difference between generated stuff and real stuff. So generative model could be used to face-swap a video — a very controversial thing of deep fakes and fake pornography happening at the moment. It could be used to fake somebody’s voice. It could be used to fake the answer to a medical question — but in that case, it’s not really a fake, it could be a generative answer to a medical question that is actually a good answer so you are generating language. You could generate a caption to an image, for example. So generative models have lots of interesting applications. But generally speaking, they need to be good enough that for example if you are using it to automatically create a new scene for Carrie Fisher in the next Star Wars movie and she is not around to play that part anymore, you want to try and generate an image of her that looks the same then it has to fool the Star Wars audience into thinking “okay, that doesn’t look like some weird Carrie Fisher — that looks like the real Carrie Fisher. Or if you are trying to generate an answer to a medical question, you want to generate English that reads nicely and clearly, and sounds authoritative and meaningful. The idea of generative adversarial network is we are going to create not just a generative model to create the generated image, but a second model that’s going to try to pick which ones are real and which ones are generated (we will call them “fake”). So we have a generator that is going to create our fake content and a discriminator that’s going to try to get good at recognizing which ones are real and which ones are fake. So there are going to be two models and they are going to be adversarial meaning the generator is going to try to keep getting better at fooling the discriminator into thinking that fake is real, and the discriminator is going to try to keep getting better at discriminating between the real and the fake. So they are going to go head to head. It is basically as easy as Jeremy just described [<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=54m14s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=54m14s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">54:14</a>]:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="23ff" id="23ff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">We are going to build two models in PyTorch</li><li name="65c6" id="65c6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We are going to create a training loop that first of all says the loss function for the discriminator is “can you tell the difference between real and fake, then update the weights of that.</li><li name="cacc" id="cacc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">We are going to create a loss function for the generator which is “can you generate something which fools the discriminator and update the weights from that loss.</li><li name="758d" id="758d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">And we are going to loop through that a few times and see what happens.</li></ul><h4 name="789c" id="789c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Looking at the code&nbsp;[<a href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=54m52s" data-href="https://youtu.be/ondivPiwQho?t=54m52s" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">54:52</a>]</h4><p name="bb0e" id="bb0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl2/wgan.ipynb" data-href="https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl2/wgan.ipynb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Notebook</a></p><p name="360e" id="360e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a lot of different things you can do with GANS.

We are just going to get it to draw some pictures. Specifically, we are going to get it to draw pictures of bedrooms. Hopefully you get a chance to play around with this during the week with your own datasets. If you pick a dataset that’s very varied like ImageNet and then get a GAN to try and create ImageNet pictures, it tends not to do so well because it’s not clear enough what you want a picture of. So it’s better to give it, for example, there is a dataset called <a href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html" data-href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CelebA</a> which is pictures of celebrities’ faces that works great with GANs.
